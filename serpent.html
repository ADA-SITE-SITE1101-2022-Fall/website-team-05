<p class="info">The students were informed about basics of coding, why we need coding and they practised the new knowledge they lerned from us on computers.<br><br>Our team members Ali, Nargiz, Rasul and Murad firstly presented a short presentation about "ADA" university and they introduced the presentation which was prepeared by them.<br><br> When the team arrived to the school, the school staff welcomed them very warmly. The computer room and students were prepered instantly to begin the class of "Hour of Code". Before the class the headmaster of LSC BSU mentioned: "It is very pleasing situation that the younger generation have such a tendancy to teach and learn."<br><br>The class began with the short information about the university. After the introduction about "ADA", team members arose a question: what is coding? The question created a general understanding about the topic. However very few students could answer the question properly, therefore we started to present our slides and show that how simple coding can be!</p>
